**01-hysteresis-indices**: Scripts to calculate and plot hysteresis indices as well as plot C-Q loops for a set of biogeochemical parameters vs. discharge.

**02-discharge-2025**: Scripts to process discharge and pressure transducer measurements and use them to develop rating curves for the 2025 data.

**03-discharge-combined-years**: Similar to (02), but combine and compare data across years.

**04-thermistors**: Basic scripts to compile and plot thermistor time series.
