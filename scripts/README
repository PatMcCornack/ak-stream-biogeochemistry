__01-hysteresis-indices__: Scripts to calculate and plot hysteresis indices as well as plot C-Q loops for a set of biogeochemical parameters vs. discharge.

__02-discharge-2025__: Scripts to process discharge and pressure transducer measurements and use them to develop rating curves for the 2025 data.

__03-discharge-combined-years__: Similar to (02), but combine and compare data across years.

__04-thermistors__: Basic scripts to compile and plot thermistor time series.
